# Lunch Metrics Condenser
## Overview

It consolidates two columns ("Lunch Purchase" and "Lunch") into one singular column ("Lunch Included"), generating a clean output file and summary metrics to assist event organizers.

File Format Support: Handles both .csv and .xlsx/.xls files for flexible input options.

Data Cleaning: Replaces verbose responses with simplified categories to reduce clutter and confusion.
